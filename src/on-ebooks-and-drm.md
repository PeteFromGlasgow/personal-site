Why do people think ebook


This week I decided to buy my first ebook, in this case due to the difficulty of finding the book I was looking for in paper form and also the fact that the paperback copy was much more expensive (which I think is the first time I've saw that happen). It's always struck me as odd that digital books were never taken up with the same enthusiasm as mobile apps, games and mobile music but now I think I have a better understanding of why. 


The markets are too closed
==========================

One of the first things I notice was that if I bought a book on Google Play I could not read that book on my Kindle or through a book reader like calibre without first stripping the DRM. The opposite isn't entirely true due to the Kindle App on Android but it's still a bit of a pain because if you by books from different stores you have to use different Apps; it isn't user friendly at all.

The books sometimes aren't optimized to well for e-readers
==========================================================

This won't apply to all books but in my case the book I bought had diagrams, these turned out tiny and distorted on my Kindle and Nexus 7. Apparently nobody bothered to check that everything looked good.
