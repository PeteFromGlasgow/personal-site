Last year I decided I needed to do a bit more outside of work, because I had somehow manage to slowly morph myself into a couch potato after a few years. I decided that it would be a good thing to do a night course at a local college or university; my reasoning is that it would be a good way to meet new people and a nice place to pick up a new skill.

There were two course that caught my eye when I was browsing through the options of what I could do, one was woodwork and the other was a course called learn to draw.

Now drawing is something that I've really been wanting to get better at for a while but I've always put it off; I love reading graphic novels, webcomics and manga; enough that made me really want to give drawing a try. Also at about Â£90 it was a bit of a steal and I was perfectly happy to give it a shot.

So I went bought a bunch of pencils and got to it!

At first I was really terrible, in my first couple of weeks of pictures I drew it was noticable that I didn't have much skill in drawing; we even done a bit of speed drawing (I had to draw it in a few minutes) which I just so happened to pick a difficult object to draw for (it was a toy truck, with lots of little bits for the horns and other stuff), Which in the end didn't look much like the original source at all. As time went on however, I even manage to surprise myself with how far my drawings came along by managing to draw a nice portrait of someones face, an accurate tree using ink, a nice drawing of a temple in Kyoto and some other things.

I have uploaded some of these pictures on this page to highlight the difference in skill from start to end.

The experience was great so I'm definitely going to do another evening or weekend class again, it might not be drawing, maybe I'll do another language or something.
