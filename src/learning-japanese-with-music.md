When you're an intermediate student of Japanese stuck in the middle of a country which is at near enough the furthest point away from Japan and where very little Japanese people ever visit, one of the most difficult things to do is keeping yourself interested while you're learning new vocabulary. Just learning random words on WaniKani or Anki without any media to back them up is only going to get you so far.

I've ran into a kind of wall with my learning recently and I've decided it needs to change this year so I came up with a new year challenge to learn as much vocabulary (with accompanying Kanji as I possibly can) before the deadline for the JLPT sign up. Then take the relevent JLPT level.

So I've been trying to think up good ways of combatting my boredom with learning new vocabulary, and I really like Japanese music so I've decided to create a set of Anki decks for myself that will help me learn new vocabulary. In this post I'm going to run through the steps I took for setting up music learning Anki decks; this should also work for other types of Japanese text so if you like reading the news this might be a good guide to follow.
