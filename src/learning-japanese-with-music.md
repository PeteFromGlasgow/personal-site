When you're an intermediate student of Japanese stuck in the middle of a country which is at near enough the furthest point away from Japan and where very little Japanese people ever visit, one of the most difficult things to do is keeping yourself interested while you're learning new vocabulary. Just learning random words on WaniKani or Anki without any media to back them up is only going to get you so far.

I've ran into a kind of wall with my learning recently and I've decided it needs to change this year so I came up with a new year challenge to learn as much vocabulary (with accompanying Kanji as I possibly can) before the deadline for the JLPT sign up. Then take the relevent JLPT level.

So I've been trying to think up good ways of combatting my boredom with learning new vocabulary, and I really like Japanese music so I've decided to create a set of Anki decks for myself that will help me learn new vocabulary. In this post I'm going to run through the steps I took for setting up music learning Anki decks; this should also work for other types of Japanese text so if you like reading the news this might be a good guide to follow.

Anki Setup
----------

The standard Anki setup can be quite tedious requiring several data inputs for one card, luckily there are some pretty cool plugins out there which make it much easier to create new 日本語 cards. The one I'm going to use for this guide is called [Yomichan](https://foosoft.net/projects/yomichan/).

I already have Anki installed and an AnkiWeb account set up so that I can sync between my laptop, PC and phone. So installing turned out to be pretty easy by adding the addon listed at the [AnkiWeb Site](https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/934748696).

Adding the Template
-------------------

Unfortunately it's not just as simple as adding the addon to Anki, even though the addon is easily available from the tools menu we need to add it's template decks

Getting Song Lyrics
-------------------

Getting Japanese song lyrics is pretty easy once you know how. You simply search for the song you want with the Japanese word 歌詞(かし) which means lyrics after it, if you want to be super grammatically correct you can search for <SONG NAME>の歌詞 instead but in my experience it didn't make much difference in results. After you've found a lyric listing you like you just copy and paste it into yomichan. You can then hover over the lyrics while holding the corresponding keys and it will give you a dictionary definition of the word. It will always give you the plain, unconjugated form in the case of adjectives and verbs.
